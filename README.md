ABI is designed to explain what you can block an what not


This information is designed to help app developer or use it for own purchases. It's designed to explain everything about advertisments or talk about the ethical reasons to do or not to do but I hope it may helps some people. 


Benefits over a firewall?
* Mostly none except that it reduce the traffic by itself, by intercepting the activitys directly.
* Battery life.
* More control.


Problems?
* The app may crash.
* The app may shows an placeholder with an missing activity which would normally show an ad exactly on this place.


This project is in beta stage !
