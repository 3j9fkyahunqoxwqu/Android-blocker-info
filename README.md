This information is designed to help app developer or use it for own purchases. It's designed to explain everything about advertisments or talk about the ethical reasons to do or not to do but I hope it may helps some people. 

There exist a lot of wannabe apps which claiming to reduce the battery life, this is all bullshit, they apps also needs to be running all the time to monitor every single activity, this can be a lot of easier done. I not say these apps are not easy for beginners, but easier not means it's the best you could use.

This is the best (I really mean best) solution for battery life and security you could get without destroying much or using alternative apps.

Example:
* com.facebook.FacebookActivity


**Benefits over a firewall?**
* Mostly none except that it reduce the traffic by itself, by intercepting the activitys directly.
* More control, less ads and less adware.
* Battery life.


**Problems?**
* The app may crash. But it should be no problem since you can at any time re-start the activity.
* The app may shows an placeholder with an missing activity which would normally show an ad exactly on this place.
* A global based solutions is difficult to implement. I might think about an app to do this, which after everything is done shutdown, but the problem is that it would require an per-app and global wide API to control certain conditions. It's a lot of work, it's unclear if the names not getting obfuscated if this method hits the mass.


**ToDO:**
* Detailed guide to submit feedback with pictures
* A method to do this without 3C Toolbox via terminal (it's already done but I need to change some steps)
* Possible think about an app which can all do this? See problems. 
* Spelling and grammar - of course my biggest weakness.
* Give more details about the goal and about the app situations on e.g. newer Android versions, since you can also restrict permission in general.
