How can I help to imrpove the project?
* The easierst method is to download and install 3C toolbox if you not want the terminal mess.
* Open the Taskmanager or the integrated App-Manager and click on permissions, now you see several tabs like Services, Activitys, ...
* See and watch which of them is really nessary, mostly (if the name not already is clear enough trial & error method). 
* If the app crashes try to re-enable everything via App-Manager and start again. 
* Submit the App + version (because maybe something changed via Issue ticket).

Do not submit illegal or modded apps like WhatsApp mods, it's welcome but I can't check everything. Of course you can suggest something but it may needs more time.
